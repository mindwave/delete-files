- Move to a testing folder for the following:
- Right now, we're appending checked items to the string "checked_list"
- Change this to deleting each item DONE!
- Does the list of items automatically refresh after deletion? NO!
- Change button label to "Delete Checked Items"
- Have the user verify the list before final deletion.
- Add some styling to the checkboxes and button.
- Can the checkboxes be in a table to show date and size better?
    - Alternatively, just show the name which already has the date. DONE!
    - Can we sort the checkboxes by date?
